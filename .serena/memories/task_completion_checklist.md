# Task Completion Checklist

## Before Marking Task Complete

### 1. Code Quality Verification
```bash
# Run type checking
npm run build    # Includes tsc -noEmit -skipLibCheck

# Verify no compilation errors
# Check that main.js is generated successfully
```

### 2. Code Style Compliance
- Follow existing naming conventions (PascalCase for classes, camelCase for methods)
- Ensure proper TypeScript typing throughout
- Fix any type inconsistencies (like MyPluginSettings → obsidianTypstPDFExportSettings)
- Maintain consistent indentation and formatting

### 3. Plugin Functionality Testing
- Test in actual Obsidian environment
- Verify plugin loads without errors
- Test core functionality manually
- Check command palette integration
- Verify settings persistence

### 4. Integration Verification
- Ensure Obsidian API usage follows best practices
- Check for proper lifecycle management (onload/onunload)
- Verify external tool dependencies are handled gracefully
- Test error handling and user feedback

### 5. Documentation Updates
- Update relevant comments in code
- Document any new interfaces or significant changes
- Keep PRD alignment in mind for feature completeness

## Development Workflow Steps
1. Make code changes
2. Run `npm run dev` for live development
3. Test in Obsidian environment
4. Run `npm run build` to verify production build
5. Check for TypeScript errors and resolve
6. Verify plugin functionality works as expected
7. Mark task complete in Task Master
